Let me think through this... [searches: gewan island demographics demand]

First, who's the buyer? Government employees, young Qataris, 
mid-income expats. Income band QAR 15-25K/month.

Quick math: If we target QAR 2-3M apartments, that's affordable 
for this segment. Monthly payment around QAR 10-15K at 70% LTV.

Now, what's the supply situation? [searches: affordable housing inventory qatar]

Wait, this is interesting. Affordable inventory at 8 months. 
Government housing wait list at 18 months. There's a gap.

I've seen this before - Abu Dhabi 2017. Same pattern. Government 
employees needed housing, no affordable supply. Developers who 
moved first captured 60% of market.

Let me challenge myself: What if demand doesn't materialize?

Scenario 1 (60% probability): Pre-sell 60% in 6 months. IRR 25%+
Scenario 2 (25% probability): Pre-sell 40% in 12 months. IRR 18%
Scenario 3 (15% probability): Pre-sell 20%, hold rest. IRR 12%

Expected value: 21.5% IRR. That clears our hurdle.

My recommendation: GO on Gewan affordable. Phase 1: 180 units, 
QAR 2.5M average. Launch Q2 2025. Pre-sell 60% before groundbreaking.

Risk: If government changes housing policy. Mitigation: Partner 
with government housing program for 25% of units.

That's my call.""")

Omar: Luxury oversupplied
Fatima: Hotels weak  
James: Government spending strong, affordable has better returns
Sarah: Infrastructure capacity available

They're each right in their domain. But they're missing the connection.

Luxury real estate weak + Luxury hotels weak = Not a demand problem.
It's a CAPITAL FLIGHT problem.

Where's the capital going? Saudi Vision 2030. NEOM. Riyadh.

Meanwhile, James says government spending is strong. That's creating 
MIDDLE-CLASS jobs. They don't buy luxury - they buy mid-market.

So the strategy isn't 'wait for luxury to recover.' It's 'PIVOT to 
mid-market NOW before competitors figure this out.'

But here's the sequencing issue Sarah raised:

Can't do Pearl immediately (infrastructure upgrades needed).
Can't do Lusail luxury (wrong segment).

Answer: Gewan Island mid-market FIRST. Infrastructure is ready.
Prove concept. Then Pearl Phase 2 if Gewan works.

PHASED STRATEGY:
Phase 1 (Q2 2025): Gewan affordable - 180 units, QAR 450M
Phase 2 (Q4 2026): Pearl affordable - IF Gewan pre-sells 60%+
Phase 3 (2027+): Lusail mid-market - After market proves out

That's the play.""")

✅ Two types of forcing functions created:

   2. OUTPUT VALIDATORS - Validate expert patterns after generation

✅ Key innovations:
   • 8 critical instructions for expert thinking
   • Cross-domain synthesis forcing
   • Automated quality scoring (0-100)
   • Pattern detection (50+ patterns)
   • Anti-pattern detection (consulting speak)

✅ Expected results:
   • Generic output: 20-30/100 → Expert output: 70-90/100
   • 2-3x quality improvement
   • Consistent veteran-level thinking

Next steps:
  1. Test with live API: python backend/app/agents/dr_omar_with_forcing.py
  2. Run full test suite: pytest tests/test_phd_expert_system.py
  3. Deploy to production agents
