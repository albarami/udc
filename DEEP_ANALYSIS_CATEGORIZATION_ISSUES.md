### üéØ TOURISM & HOSPITALITY: **~30 TRUE DATASETS** (OF 44)

#### ‚úÖ Core Tourism/Hotel Data (11 datasets) - CRITICAL FOR UDC:
1. **Accommodation Data by Segment (Supply, Demand, Occupancy, ADR, RevPAR)** - MOST IMPORTANT
2. Number of Hotel Beds by Hotel Class
3. Number of Hotel Guests and Nights of Stay by Month
4. Number of Hotel Guests and Nights of Stay by Nationality
5. Number of Hotel Gulf Guests and Nights of Stay by Country
6. Number of Hotel Rooms by Hotel Class
7. Number of Hotels by Hotel Class
8. Number of hotels, rooms and beds by hotel type
9. Travel & Tourism Development Index (TTDI)
10. Visitor Arrivals by Mode of Entry
11. Visitor Arrivals by Region

#### ‚úÖ Hospitality Industry Economics (~15 datasets):
- Economic Indicators in Hotels and Restaurants
- Estimates of Value Added in Hotels and Restaurants
- Production Value of Hotels and Restaurants
- Revenues of Hotels and Restaurants Current Activity
- Number of Employees in Hotels and Restaurants
*These are valuable for analyzing the hospitality INDUSTRY*

#### ‚úÖ Visitor Attractions (5 datasets) - Marginal relevance:
- Number of Movie Theaters visitors
- Zoo visitors (Al-Khor Zoo, Panda House Park)
- Park visitors by Municipality

#### ‚ùå MISCLASSIFIED - SHOULD BE REMOVED (3 datasets):
- **Number of Visitors to Health Centers** (2 variations) - This is HEALTHCARE, not tourism
- **Total Exports by Main Country of Destination** (2 variations) - This is TRADE, not tourism

### üîç THE REAL PROBLEM: WHERE IS THE REST OF THE REAL ESTATE DATA?

**Qatar has 1,149 datasets. A real estate development company should have:**
- Construction permits data
- Building permits by zone/municipality
- Property transaction volumes
- Property prices by area
- Land use data
- Zoning regulations data
- Construction activity indicators
- Real estate market indicators
- Property development projects
- Land registry data

**These datasets MUST exist in the Qatar government data portal. They're probably:**
1. **Sitting in "Economic & Financial" (584 datasets)** - misclassified
2. **Sitting in "Infrastructure & Utilities" (131 datasets)** - construction-related
3. **Sitting in "Population & Demographics" (325 datasets)** - housing-related

---

### üéØ WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN:

#### PHASE 1: CLEAN UP EXISTING CATEGORIES

**Real Estate & Construction:** Remove 27 misclassified datasets
- Result: ~10 true real estate datasets

**Tourism & Hospitality:** Remove 3 misclassified datasets  
- Result: ~41 tourism-related datasets

#### PHASE 2: DEEP SEARCH IN ECONOMIC & FINANCIAL (584 DATASETS)

Need to manually review and search for:
- **"permit"** - building permits, construction permits
- **"license"** - business licenses for construction/real estate
- **"certificate"** - certificates of completion, occupancy certificates  
- **"transaction"** - property transactions
- **"development"** - urban development, real estate development
- **"planning"** - urban planning, zoning
- **"contractor"** - contractor registrations, contractor activities
- **"project"** - construction projects, infrastructure projects
- **"market"** - real estate market indicators
- **"price"** - property prices, construction cost indices

#### PHASE 3: REVIEW INFRASTRUCTURE & UTILITIES (131 DATASETS)

Construction-related datasets that might be miscategorized:
- Construction material statistics
- Construction equipment data
- Infrastructure project data
- Building utilities connections

#### PHASE 4: REVIEW POPULATION & DEMOGRAPHICS (325 DATASETS)

Housing-related datasets that are actually real estate:
- Housing demand data
- Household composition affecting housing needs
- Population growth by area (affects real estate demand)

### üìä EXPECTED FINAL DISTRIBUTION (AFTER PROPER CATEGORIZATION):

| Category | Current | After Cleanup | After Deep Search | Target |
|----------|---------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **Real Estate & Construction** | 37 | ~10 | **40-60** | 50+ |
| **Tourism & Hospitality** | 44 | ~41 | **45-50** | 45+ |
| **Economic & Financial** | 584 | ~555 | **500-520** | 450-500 |
| **Infrastructure & Utilities** | 131 | ~135 | **120-130** | 130 |
| **Population & Demographics** | 325 | ~325 | **310-320** | 300 |

---

### üí° THE ROOT CAUSE:

**The categorizer is keyword-based and SUPERFICIAL.**

It matches:
- "hotel" ‚Üí Tourism ‚úÖ  
- "property" ‚Üí Real Estate ‚úÖ

But it MISSES:
- "permit for commercial building" ‚Üí Should be Real Estate, currently Economic
- "construction activity indicator" ‚Üí Should be Real Estate, currently Economic  
- "business establishment by sector" ‚Üí If it includes real estate sector, should be Real Estate
- "licenses issued by municipality" ‚Üí Could include construction licenses, currently Economic

**THE FIX:**
Need to:
1. Actually READ dataset descriptions, not just titles
2. Understand CONTEXT - what sector is this data about?
3. Look at metadata - what themes/tags are assigned?
4. Check the actual CSV content - what columns does it have?

---

### üö® NEXT ACTIONS:

1. **IMMEDIATE:** Write a script that reads descriptions and metadata carefully
2. **SHORT TERM:** Manually review top 100 Economic & Financial datasets  
3. **MEDIUM TERM:** Check actual CSV file columns to understand content
4. **LONG TERM:** Use LLM to understand dataset content semantically

---

**CONCLUSION:**

We don't have a "Real Estate with 37 datasets" problem.  
We have a **"Real Estate with only 10 datasets, and 30-50 more hidden in other categories" problem.**

The solution isn't to improve keyword matching.  
The solution is to actually **UNDERSTAND what each dataset contains** by reading descriptions, checking metadata, and potentially sampling the actual data.

This will take time. But it's the difference between:
- ‚ùå A system that **looks** like it has real estate data
- ‚úÖ A system that **actually provides** real estate insights for billion-riyal decisions
