## 💎 OUTPUT QUALITY EXAMPLES

### **Quantified Recommendations:**
```
"26–29% IRR in 24–30 months"
"≥60% pre-sales within 90 days at ≥QAR 9,500/sqm"
"70% debt at ≤4.5% (WACC ≤7.5%)"
"OPEX ≤QAR 22/sqm/month"
```

### **Kill Criteria (Risk-Aware):**
```
"<40% pre-sold within 60 days → pause, reprice, or cancel Phase 1"
"If final GMP >QAR 6,800/sqm or program >22 months → re-scope before NTP"
"If mortgage subsidies withdrawn and allocations <15% → re-evaluate Phase 1 scale"
```

### **Conditional Decision Making:**
```
Conditional GO: Proceed with Affordable Premium at The Pearl - Phase 1
Subject to 4 conditions within 8-10 weeks:
1) Utilities secured with ≤QAR 100M net UDC share
2) OPEX ≤QAR 22/sqm/month
3) 70% debt at ≤4.5%
4) ≥60% pre-sales in 90 days

NO-GO on Lusail Luxury until:
- Pre-sales ≥60% in 90 days at ≥QAR 18,000/sqm
- Hospitality RevPAR stabilizes for 2 consecutive quarters
- UDC equity ≤30% in JV with international brand
```

### **Strategic Sophistication:**
```
"This barbell preserves liquidity, captures certain 26–29% IRR in 24–30 
months at The Pearl, and keeps optionality for a de-risked Lusail luxury 
entry when cycles and indicators justify it."
```

## 🔧 TECHNICAL FIXES APPLIED

### **1. Import Path Resolution**
**Issue:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'backend'`  
**Fix:** Changed `from backend.adaptive_prompts` → `from adaptive_prompts`  
**Files:** `backend/agent_prompts.py`, `backend/agents.py`, `backend/ultimate_council.py`

### **2. File Renaming**
**Issue:** Multiple versions causing confusion  
**Fix:**  
- Backed up: `agent_prompts.py` → `agent_prompts_ORIGINAL_BACKUP.py`
- Replaced: `agent_prompts_new.py` → `agent_prompts.py`

### **3. Python Cache Clearing**
**Issue:** Old imports cached  
**Fix:** Removed `__pycache__` directories in `backend/` and `scripts/`

### **4. Timeout Configuration**
**Issue:** `Streaming is required for operations that may take longer than 10 minutes`  
**Fix:**  
```python
# Client-level timeout
self.anthropic = anthropic.Anthropic(
    api_key=anthropic_key,
    timeout=600.0  # 10 minutes
)

# Call-level timeout
message = self.anthropic.messages.create(
    model="claude-sonnet-4-5",
    timeout=600.0,  # 10 minutes for deep reasoning
    ...
)
```

## 🎯 BEFORE VS AFTER COMPARISON

### **BEFORE (Old Prompts):**
```
CEO: "Should we invest in Lusail?"

System: "Based on transaction data showing 12% volume growth and 
stable pricing at 18 months supply, market fundamentals appear solid. 
Recommend investment with standard risk mitigation strategies including 
diversification, phased development, and market monitoring."
```
**Quality:** Generic, corporate-speak, no specifics

---

### **AFTER (Adaptive Prompts):**
```
CEO: "Should we invest in Lusail?"

System: "Conditional GO: Affordable Premium at The Pearl (NOT Lusail luxury)

Why The Pearl, not Lusail?
- Mid-market inventory: 8 months (healthy) vs luxury: 36 months (distressed)
- Target IRR: 26-29% in 24-30 months (high confidence)
- GCC capital flowing to Riyadh (Vision 2030) → luxury demand weak

Conditions (must meet within 8-10 weeks):
1. Utilities: ≤QAR 100M net UDC share
2. OPEX: ≤QAR 22/sqm/month
3. Financing: 70% debt at ≤4.5%
4. Pre-sales: ≥60% in 90 days at ≥QAR 9,500/sqm

Kill criteria:
- <40% pre-sold in 60 days → pause/reprice/cancel
- GMP >QAR 6,800/sqm → re-scope
- Subsidies withdrawn + allocations <15% → re-evaluate

Immediate actions (start this week):
1. Freeze Lusail capex (save QAR 10-15M)
2. Launch Pearl infra workstream (budget QAR 1.2M)
3. Secure QAR 1.0B Ijara at ≤4.5%

NO-GO on Lusail until market conditions improve (12+ months)."
```
**Quality:** Specific, actionable, quantified, risk-aware, CEO-ready

## 🎓 WHAT MAKES IT "ADAPTIVE"?

### **1. Iterative Data Retrieval**
```
Round 1: "Real estate Qatar market"
Round 2: "Lusail residential transactions 2024"
Round 3: "GCC investor property purchases"
Round 4: "Pearl vs Lusail pricing comparison"
```

### **2. Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition**
```
"Luxury real estate weak + luxury hotels weak + government spending strong?
That's not DEMAND problem → It's SEGMENT problem!
Pivot from luxury to mid-market across ALL assets."
```

### **3. Experiential Reasoning**
```
"I've seen this before in Dubai 2014..."
"When oil was at $75 in 2016, luxury crashed 35%"
"If GCC investors pulling back, they're going to Riyadh"
```

### **4. Assumption Challenging**
```
"What if I'm wrong?"
"What data would disprove my hypothesis?"
"Risk: If oil hits $100, I'm wrong. But I wouldn't bet on it."
```

### **5. Multi-Level Strategic Thinking**
```
LEVEL 1: Surface (volumes up 12%, prices flat)
LEVEL 2: Pattern (unusual - investigate)
LEVEL 3: Root Cause (bifurcation - luxury 36mo, mid 8mo)
LEVEL 4: Second-Order (luxury prices drop in 6-12mo)
LEVEL 5: Strategic (avoid luxury, buy distressed)
LEVEL 6: Risk (what could I be wrong about?)
```
