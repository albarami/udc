## üîß API Usage Examples

### Python Example
```python
import requests
import pandas as pd

def download_qatar_dataset(dataset_id):
    """Download dataset from Qatar Open Data Portal"""
    url = f"https://www.data.gov.qa/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/{dataset_id}/exports/csv"
    response = requests.get(url)
    
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Save to file
        filename = f"{dataset_id}.csv"
        with open(filename, 'wb') as f:
            f.write(response.content)
        
        # Load into pandas (note: delimiter is semicolon)
        df = pd.read_csv(filename, sep=';')
        return df
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}")
        return None

# Example usage
df = download_qatar_dataset("gdp-by-activity-at-current-prices-2019-2023")
print(df.head())
```

### cURL Example
```bash
# Download multiple datasets
datasets=(
    "buildings-by-buildings-status-and-municipality-in-census-2010-20200"
    "number-of-hotel-guests-and-nights-of-stay-by-nationality"
    "gdp-by-activity-at-current-prices-2019-2023"
    "population-by-municipality-and-age-groups"
)

for dataset in "${datasets[@]}"; do
    echo "Downloading $dataset..."
    curl "https://www.data.gov.qa/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/$dataset/exports/csv" \
         -o "data_${dataset}.csv"
done
```

## üìä Data Integration Tips

### 1. CSV Delimiter
‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Qatar datasets use **semicolon (;)** as delimiter, not comma!

```python
# Correct way to read
df = pd.read_csv('data.csv', sep=';')
```

### 2. Bilingual Fields
Many datasets have both English and Arabic columns:
- English fields: `municipality`, `gender`, `occupation`
- Arabic fields: `lbldy` (municipality), `ljns` (gender)

### 3. Date Formats
- Year fields: Usually named `year` or `years`
- Dates may be in various formats - check metadata

### 4. Handling Large Datasets
Use the records API with pagination:
```python
url = f"https://www.data.gov.qa/api/explore/v2.1/catalog/datasets/{dataset_id}/records"
params = {
    'limit': 100,
    'offset': 0
}
response = requests.get(url, params=params)
```
