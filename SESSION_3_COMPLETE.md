## 🧪 Quality Assessment

### Response Quality: **A+**

**Dr. James responses demonstrate:**

**Example Excellence:**
> "HDC's operating margin of -33.3% is dragging down UDC's profitability. 
> I recommend divestment to eliminate 90% of losses (QAR 50M/year savings)
> and release QAR 800M in capital for higher-return projects like Gewan 
> (16.5% IRR vs HDC's negative returns)."

This is **exactly** the level of analysis a CEO needs!
