First, who's the buyer? [searches: demographics income]

QAR 15-25K/month income band. Quick math: At QAR 2.5M, that's 
QAR 10-12K monthly payment at 70% LTV. Works for the segment.

Now supply... [searches: affordable inventory]

8 months inventory. Government wait list: 18 months. There's a gap.

I've seen this before. Abu Dhabi 2017. Same pattern. Developers 
who moved first got 60% market share.

Let me challenge myself: What if demand doesn't hit?

Scenario 1 (60%): Pre-sell 60%, IRR 25%
Scenario 2 (25%): Pre-sell 40%, IRR 18%
Scenario 3 (15%): Pre-sell 20%, IRR 12%

Expected: 21.5% IRR. Clears hurdle.

My call: GO on Gewan. Launch Q2 2025. Partner with government 
for 25% of units. Gate the risk - if no 60% pre-sales in 90 days, stop.

That's how I'd play it.
