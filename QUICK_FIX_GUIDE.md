# üîß QUICK FIX - 5 MINUTES TO GET RUNNING

## Current Status:
‚úÖ Adaptive prompts created (`backend/adaptive_prompts.py`)  
‚úÖ Interface file created (`backend/agent_prompts_new.py`)  
‚ö†Ô∏è Import paths need adjustment

---

## Option 1: Simple Rename (RECOMMENDED - 2 minutes)

```powershell
cd d:\udc\backend

# Backup original
Copy-Item agent_prompts.py agent_prompts_original_backup.py

# Replace with new adaptive version
Remove-Item agent_prompts.py
Rename-Item agent_prompts_new.py agent_prompts.py
```

**Then test:**
```powershell
cd d:\udc
python scripts/test_ultimate_council.py
```

---

## Option 2: Update All Imports (5 minutes)

**Files to update:**
1. `backend/agents.py` - ‚úÖ Already done
2. `backend/ultimate_council.py` - ‚úÖ Already done  
3. Any other files that import `AGENT_PROMPTS`

**Then test:**
```powershell
python scripts/test_ultimate_council.py
```

## How to Verify Adaptive Intelligence is Working:

Look for these markers in the output:

**1. Iterative Thinking:**
```
"Let me search for... Hmm, that's not quite right. Let me refine..."
```

**2. Pattern Recognition:**
```
"I've seen this before in Dubai 2014..."
"This reminds me of when oil was at $75 in 2016..."
```

**3. Cross-Domain Insights:**
```
"Luxury real estate AND luxury hotels both weak, BUT government 
spending strong? That's not a demand problem - it's a SEGMENT problem."
```

**4. Assumption Challenging:**
```
"What could I be wrong about? If oil hits $100 and Saudi capital 
floods back, luxury will recover. But I wouldn't bet on it."
```

**5. Executive Communication:**
```
"Don't do it. Here's why..."
"We're at 72% occupancy - that's the danger zone..."
"Up 8% in arrivals but I'm not celebrating..."
```

---

## If Still Getting Import Errors:

**Check Python path:**
```powershell
python -c "import sys; print('\n'.join(sys.path))"
```

**Manual import test:**
```powershell
cd d:\udc\backend
python -c "from adaptive_prompts import DR_OMAR_ADAPTIVE_PROMPT; print('SUCCESS')"
```

**If that works, the issue is path resolution. Use Option 1 (rename).**

---

## üéØ That's It!

Once imports are fixed, the system will immediately use the new adaptive prompts.

**No other changes needed** - same architecture, same models, better intelligence!
