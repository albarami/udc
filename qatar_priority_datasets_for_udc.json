It includes data on certificates such as GCC Certificates and general Certificates of Origin, organized by year, type, and country.\n\nThe dataset is useful for analyzing trade trends and export destinations of products exported by Qatar’s private sector, especially small and medium enterprises.\n\nThese certificates of origin are issued based on five main models:\n\nGeneral Certificate (for exports to countries without preferential/customs agreements)\n\nGCC Certificate (for exports to Gulf Cooperation Council countries, including local content details)\n\nArab Certificate (issued under the trade facilitation agreement among Arab states)\n\nPreferential Certificate (for countries with free trade agreements with Qatar)\n\nBilateral Agreement Certificate (based on specific agreements requiring unique origin criteria)\n\nIt’s important to distinguish this dataset from the comprehensive export statistics published by the National Statistics Center. While Qatar Chamber data reflects certificates issued for exports requiring origin documentation, the National Statistics Center provides a full view of Qatar’s exports using customs data from the General Authority of Customs. These national-level statistics include oil, gas, non-oil, and re-export figures and are classified by HS Code, destination, value in Qatari Riyal, quantity or weight, and export type.\n\nTherefore, this dataset gives a partial yet insightful view into private sector export patterns, complementing but not replacing the official national export data.\"</span></font></p>",
